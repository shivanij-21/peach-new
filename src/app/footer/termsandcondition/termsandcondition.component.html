                <ul>
                    <li>-&gt; You, or people associated with You may have directly or indirectly influenced the outcome of an event;</li>
                    <li>-&gt; You, or people associated with You may have access to insider knowledge that can influence the outcome of an event;</li>
                    <li>-&gt; You, or people associated with You are engaged in arbitrage or matched betting;</li>
                    <li>-&gt; You and or people associated with You directly or indirectly ignore the Rules;</li>
                    <li>-&gt; The result of an event has been directly or indirectly affected by criminal activity;</li>
                    <li>-&gt; A significant change in odds happened, for example due to a public announcement in relation to an event;</li>
                    <li>-&gt; Bets have been offered, placed and/or accepted that We would not have accepted, due to a technical issue affecting the Site at that point in time or a mistake, misprint and/or anything which is outside Our control.</li>

                    for any losses up to the point the Account was closed, nor will We consider any refunds on balances remaining on the Account. ‘Abuse’ is defined as, but not limited to, software-aided play on multiple games concurrently to generate
                    more rounds of a game that could not be done naturally by a human player playing alone. Also, the practice of ‘cherry-picking’ games with ‘value’ jackpots, to the rank exclusion of all other games, will be considered an abuse of
                    the spirit in which the jackpot is intended. In all cases where abuse has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, We retain the right to confiscate all of the winnings and any balance remaining on the Account.

                    such other currency as is made available in the currency drop down from time to time. You must choose one currency as the currency of Your Account. Any payments received in a currency other than the one chosen by you will be converted

                <h5>9.2 Payouts When the outcome of a Game You take part in is determined, or when We confirm the result of an event, any winnings will be made available to you on Your Account. If We mistakenly credit Your Account with winnings that do
                    not belong to You for any reason, these will be taken back from Your Account. If You have withdrawn these winnings before We become aware of this error, You must immediately inform Us and will be required to pay this back. If You
                    do not We will take all legal action available to us to recover this debt.</h5>

                    You must first cancel any outstanding stakes. You agree that funds in Your Account must only be used for playing the Games found on the Site. If You request a withdrawal without turning over an amount that is equal or more than
                    the amount deposited, We reserve the right to enforce a turnover of the full or part of the previous deposit(s) made and/or charge a fee on the withdrawal requested. We can reject a withdrawal request if We suspect that funds are
                    being withdrawn for any fraudulent or money laundering reasons. Prior to accepting a withdrawal, We may request that You provide legal identification, for example certified copies of passports, ID cards or other such documentation
                    as We feel is required in the circumstances. We may also carry out phone verification, face verification or other such verification as is required to ensure that You are who You say You are. If You withdraw an amount which cumulatively
                    exceed EUR 2,000 (or the equivalent in Your Account currency) We will carry out additional verification procedures. We may also carry out these verification procedures even in the case of lower withdrawals. Where a withdrawal is
                    to be made using a credit card, We may request a certified copy of that credit card (front and back). Please ensure that only the first 6 digits and the last 4 digits of the card are visible and that the CVV /CVV2 number on the
                    back of the card is also not visible. All withdrawals must be done through the same payment method chosen by You when placing a deposit, unless We decide otherwise or are unable to do so. If You deposit using a number of payment
                    methods, We reserve the right to split Your withdrawal across such payment methods and process each part through the respective payment method at Our discretion and in accordance with anti-money laundering policies and regulations.
                    The time for a withdrawal request to be finalised may vary due to circumstances, however a withdrawal attempt should be approved or denied within three (3) business days. When a withdrawal is cancelled, the funds are returned back
                    to your account and you can make use of those funds accordingly on the account. webiste does not assume any responsibility for any funds lost during gameplay following a withdrawal cancellation either by you or by us. All winnings

                    discretion to request a withdrawal every month until the funds are entirely paid out. We may request that You redirect Your withdrawal or cancel it or request that it is redirected to a different method of withdrawal in accordance
                    with anti-money laundering polices and/or regulations. Cancellation of a withdrawal (whether this was made by You or Us) does not entitle You to any compensation should You choose to play with the funds in Your Account before any
                    withdrawal is completed. We reserve the right to charge an administrative fee in the event that You proceed with more than 30 approved withdrawals/payout requests during one (1) calendar month. The administrative fee shall be 2%
                    of the transaction value but no less than EUR 5. It shall be charged on each withdrawal following the 30th withdrawal within each given month.</h5>
                <h5>9.4 Chargebacks If a chargeback on a card or depositing method You have used is requested by the payment method provider, We may take the following steps:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>-&gt; We may block Your Account;</li>

                <h5>12.3 Some Bonuses must be manually activated by You in Your Account. Unless stated otherwise, You can do this after logging into Your Account and depositing the amount required to access the Bonus. Such Bonuses can only be activated
                    when real money is available in Your Account. If You play with any of Your deposited funds prior to claiming the Bonus, lost funds cannot be used to activate the Bonus.</h5>
                <h5>12.4 When You claim a Bonus, Your real money, the Bonus and all winnings generated from them will remain as Bonus money and may not be withdrawn or wagered on other products until wagering requirements are met.</h5>
                <h5>12.5 All Bonuses have a wagering requirement that needs to be completed within a given time frame before any potential winnings and/or bonuses can be withdrawn. Failure to meet the required wagering requirements and/or forfeit of an
                    active Bonus for any reason may result in the forfeit of all winnings attained from Your real money as well as Your Bonus and bonus winnings attained throughout the wagering process of the Bonus. Any attempt to withdraw any funds
                    or cash out any placed bets prior to the complete fulfilment of the Bonus wagering requirement, may result in the Bonus and any winnings attained (including winnings that originated from Your real money used to get the Bonus) being
                    forfeited. System bets do not count towards the wagering requirements. Only bets that have been placed and settled during the campaign period will be considered towards the wagering requirements. Any bets that are placed and settled
                    outside this period will not count.</h5>
                <h5>12.6 Any evidence or reasonable suspicion that specific bets were placed on any Game (i.e. betting in proportions on different outcomes in the same hand to create "action") without risk will not qualify for any wagering requirement.
                    Examples of bets without risk include betting on red and black simultaneously in Roulette, and betting player and banker simultaneously in Baccarat. If You are found to be colluding with other players, for example, one person betting
                    on the player, the other betting on the banker, You will have Your bets cancelled, Account closed and all deposits made by You may be forfeited.</h5>
                <h5>12.7 If You cancel the Bonus You will lose the Bonus and all winnings generated from the Bonus.</h5>
                <h5>12.8 We have the right to refuse any player a Bonus or We may alter the Bonus (including cancellation), if We believe that:</h5>

                    <li>-&gt; Technical issues have occurred in relation to the Bonus;</li>
                    <li>-&gt; The Bonus is, for any reason, not able to be conducted as planned.</li>
                </ul>

                    and any balances remaining on Your Account.</h5>
                <h5>12.10 All Bonuses are intended for recreational players and/or as tokens of appreciation to Our customers and We therefore reserve the right to restrict eligibility to participate in all or part of any Bonus.</h5>

                    in the Bonus Terms and Conditions:</h5>
                <ul>

                <h5>13.1 Gambling can be addictive. If You need some help to overcome such addiction, kindly follow this link which will redirect You to Our Responsible Gaming page on the Site. Please always gamble responsibly.</h5>
                <h5>13.2 Limits You may impose limits on Your Account. These limits are:</h5>
                <h5>13.2.1 Deposit Limit You may choose to limit Your maximum losses. This limit will automatically block any further deposits made if the deposit limit set has been exceeded for that selected time frame.</h5>
                <h5>13.2.2 Session Time Limit You may choose to limit the time You spend enjoying Our Games. This pop up will appear, reminding You of the time limit You imposed on yourself and will allow you to log You out of Your Account or continue
                    enjoying Our games. Kindly contact support to be able to set this limit. Where a session time limit falls on the hour, this pop up will be replaced by the Reality Check if you are resident outside of the United Kingdom. If You
                    change Your mind, these limits can be changed by letting Us know via e-mail. Increasing or revoking a limit shall have effect only after seven (7) days; whereas decreasing a limit shall have effect immediately.</h5>
                <h5>13.3 Reality Check If You are resident outside of the United Kingdom and only when playing on casino Games on the Site, a pop up will appear which will pause Your Game to remind You that you have been playing for one hour. This will
                    be done every hour. This pop up will remind You of how much You lost and how much You won. You will then select to continue to enjoy Our Games or log out. This pop up might appear later than the automatic one hour schedule if Your
                    Game does not allow for temporary suspension. This pop up will appear immediately after Your Game ends once You have come back to Our lobby. We will not always be able to apply the Session Time Limit or Reality Check on the time
                    promised. For example, if You play auto spin games, live games or games which are not hosted on Our Site We will be unable to apply the Session Time Limit or Reality Check reminders until the game has finished or You return to
                    Our lobby. You can deactivate the Reality Check at any time by opting-out on the pop up. If You would like to reactivate this, kindly contact support or refer to the ‘My Account’ tab.</h5>

                    any noncash prizes or invitations which have been granted to You or offered to You prior to such self-exclusion but which have not yet been redeemed or utilised by You (for example, where tickets for an event have been offered
                    but the event is to take place during a self-exclusion period, the invitation is automatically withdrawn upon self-exclusion) . This is to prevent gambling being promoted to You in a time where You have taken some time to assess
                    Your gambling behaviour.</h5>
                <h5>13.4.3 You may also choose to “cool off” if you are a UK resident. You may want to take a break from gambling and a ‘cooling off period’ can be set for a period of: 24 hours, 1 week, 3 weeks or 6 weeks. Please contact support or visit
