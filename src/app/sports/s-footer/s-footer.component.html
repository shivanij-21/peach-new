                                                        Halftime/Fulltime:- Predict the result of a match at
                                                        halftime and at the end of regular time. If a game
                                                        is abandoned, bets will be void. Example: If you
                                                        choose 1/X, you bet on the home team to lead in the
                                                        first half and the match to end in a draw. Extra
                                                        time doesn’t count.
